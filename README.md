This project is a JavaScript-based soccer ball animation where users can control the animation speed and the number of bouncing balls on a virtual court. 
The HTML file sets up a webpage with options to choose animation speed and the number of balls. 
The JavaScript code initializes the animation, handles user input, and manages the physics of ball movement, collision, and rebound within the specified court boundaries. 
The animation creates a visually engaging experience with bouncing soccer balls, and users can toggle the animation on and off. 
The project combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an interactive and dynamic soccer ball simulation.

Getting Started:

Code Structure:
The HTML file (index.html) sets up the webpage structure.
CSS styles for the soccer ball and court are defined in the <style> section.
The JavaScript file (soccer.js) manages animation initialization, user input, and ball physics.
